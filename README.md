# Curriculum vitae
This repository contains the source files that I used to create my CV with the [`vitae` package](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae).

The files include:
- The R markdown file and its PDF output
- The CSL file for APA 6th edition that I edited to produce the correct formatting for the poster sessions
- The CSL file generated by running the markdown file
- The LUA file that allows me to include multiple bibliographies and forces pandoc to handle the citations (as opposed to the custom TeX file in the `vitae` package)
- My bibliographies, one for publications (which I pull directly from Google Scholar) and the other for posters and presentations (which I include manually)
- The data folder that includes my CSV files for each section entry

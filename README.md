# Curriculum vitae
This repository contains the source files that I used to create my CV with the [`vitae` package](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae).

The files include:
- The main R markdown file that uses the `awesome-cv` template
- The R script that takes the TEX file output from R markdown, bolds my name in the references, and compiles the final PDF
- The CSL file that I edited to produce the correct formatting for the poster sessions
- My bibliographies, one for publications (which I pulled directly from Google Scholar) and the other for posters and presentations (which I included manually)
- The data folder that includes my CSV files for each section entry
- The CSL file (which I've edited) and font folder generated by running the markdown file
